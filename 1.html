      I'm just writing something. I am always learning. I want to live happily.
    Estoy menos cansado. Yo Hablo no espanol. Pero hablo bien ingles. i should write something to see what is the
    facility of the tag named br. It stands for the line breaker. i think programmars have to be good at Engish
    because many of tags are made by English names. I think I wrote these texts pretty long. Maybe it is time
    to execute this tag.

    <br><br>..Or I should keep saying something. I have to improve, I'm not bad, but I am not enough.
    I was in bad mood this year. I felt always despressed and i couldn't find any meaning in this life, and world.
    I had the nihilism. Maybe I have that even now. I cannot say it is a bad thing because it has the bright side.
    Oh, I think now I'm ready to apply the tag.

    <br><br>br tag has a facility of line lifting. As you add br tags,
    you can lift as many lines as you can.

    <p> And there's a p tag. It is similar ot br tag, but it has more meaning
    than br tag beacause this tag let someone know this is a one paragraph. The difference between br tag and
    p tag is that br tag dosen't have a finish tag but p tag does. <strong>Searching engine uses tag to let people see
    proper resluts, so we should use right tag to go up on the search result page.<u> We must use a right tag on a
    right purpose.</u></strong></p>
